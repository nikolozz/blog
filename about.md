A seasoned Software Engineer with more than 5 years of experience, I specialize in mastering NodeJS and its internals, along with a solid grasp on databases, particularly RDBMS. With a robust understanding of OOAD and OOP principles, I have written TypeScript libraries for the internal use of the companies. My journey with leading enterprise companies has refined my skillset, ready to add value in a dynamic environment.
